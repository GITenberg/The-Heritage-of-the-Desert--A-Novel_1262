description: John Hare lies dying in the desert until he is discovered and saved by
  the kind and generous rancher, August Naab. As Hare is nursed back to health on
  Naab's ranch, he finds himself irresistibly attracted to Naab's adopted daughter,
  Mescal. But Mescal is being relentlessly pursued by Holderness, a man who is not
  to be trusted. Hare is soon drawn into a web of adventure and intrigue over land,
  water, and the heart of a beautiful woman, all set against the sweeping backdrop
  of the Wild West.
